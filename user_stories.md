##Marketing Research Team

As a member of the marketing research team, I am interested in learning which product images are clicked on by the user. I would like to see a list of the number of times each image is clicked upon repeat without duplicating the previous rounds images.

##Developer

As a developer, I am interested in creating a function to select three random photos from an index of images without duplicating the previous rounds images. I would like to calculate the number of times each image is displayed and the number of times each image is clicked, and show the results in the browser window. .

##Focus Group Participant 1

As a focus group participant, I want to participate in this market research activity with a clear process to achieve a meaningful result. I would like clear instructions and for the activity to function smoothly.

##Focus Group Participant 2

As a focus group participant, I want to be able to see the image names and know how many clicks I have left.

###Step by step instructions:

Each image will be stored in an index. A random number function will be used to access the index of images. There will need to be an additional variable counting up to the 25 question total. This will require a for loop going though the object until the index reaches 25 questions.

The three images to be displayed at one given time will need to be stored within a single html div. An additional if statement will be used to account for the user clicking the image. Each image selected will be stored in an array for result population following the objects completion.
